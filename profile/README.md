## PoC: Federated Learning Demonstrator

The Federated Learning Platform from the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en) is launched as
part of the [Catena-X Automotive Network](https://catena-x.net/en) project which was sponsored by the
[German Federal Ministry of Economics Affairs and Climate Action](https://www.bmwk.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html).
The entire platform is a Prove of Concept (PoC).
It is intended to show that decentralized machine learning is possible in the industry and the Catena-X automotive network.
